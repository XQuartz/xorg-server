    Note: the server currently always returns value_type = XSyncAbsolute (0)
    in the QueryAlarm reply, so the missing swap has no observable effect
    (swap(0) == 0).  We set value_type = SyncRelative when creating the
    alarm to future-proof against the server returning the actual
    value_type.  If the server ever starts returning the stored
